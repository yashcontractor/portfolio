My name is Yash Contractor, and I am currently in my fifth year of studying Computer Engineering. I am constantly seeking new opportunities to enhance my experience in the realm of Software Development. 

Through my recent and previous experience at [<span style="color:#7698D4">*Flinks*</span>](https://flinks.com/). as a Software Developer Intern, my interest grew in the field of financial technology where I worked with testing the backend of the an API that is aligned to communicate financial data between our clients and their end users. I was also able to effectively develop and apply my knowledge to build a front end system using Angular.js, that helped developers navigate data of financial accounts. 
 
My knowledge and skills in Software development have furthered enhanced through my experience as a Software Developer at [<span style="color:#7698D4">*Software For Love*</span>](https://www.softwareforlove.com/), a non-profit organization aimed to develop software solutions for clients in exchange to provide donations to charity. Being able to contribute my skills in React.js, to have a direct impact on people in need made me very passionate to be a part of it. This experience further allowed me to communicate effectively with my team and strengthened my ability to learn new technologies and meet deadlines in a timely manner.
 
I am currently searching for related part-time or full-time experience, where I would love to grow my knowledge and understanding in my field of software development.
