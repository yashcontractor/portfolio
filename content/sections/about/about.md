I'm Yash Contractor, currently pursuing my fifth year in Computer Engineering. I have a strong passion for software development and constantly strive to enhance my skills. During my internship at Flinks, I gained valuable experience in the field of financial technology. I focused on backend testing and had the opportunity to build a user-friendly front-end system using Angular.js. Additionally, I worked as a Software Developer at Software For Love, a non-profit organization where I used my expertise in React.js to develop software solutions while making a positive impact on the lives of those in need. I am currently seeking part-time or full-time positions that will allow me to continue expanding my knowledge and expertise in the dynamic field of software development.
